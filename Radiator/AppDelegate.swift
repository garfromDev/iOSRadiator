/*
 APP STRUCTURE
 the source of truth are the distant files (today in FTP repo)
 There is one instance of UserInteractionManager (UIM) (singleton)
 All controllers get the model from the UIM
 All controllers locally update model in response to user action and push to UIM
 UIM pull from distant repo (Backgroundfetch or other mechanism) and triggers
 UIUpdate notification.
 controller refresh model from UIM and update their UI upon this notification
 
 Principles :
 controllers are as light as possible
 they are specific to the app
 they know the model, all interactions through UIM
 it means we can change the distant file structure (REST instead of FTP, od even SQL) without impact
 UIM do not need to know how many controller, which can of UI ...
